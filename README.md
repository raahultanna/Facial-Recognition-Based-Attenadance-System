# Facial-Recognition-Based-Attenadance-System
This repository contains codes for FRBAS(Facial Recognition Based Attendance System). Technology used in it is Tkinter(GUI-Interface) and OpenCV(Opensource Computer Vision). I am going to use many modules/libraries for this project. You have to make two empty directories naming them ImagesUnknown & TrainingImage(without any whitespace).

Main Modules needed are:
1.Tkinter 
2.OpenCV 
3.Cv2 
4.Numpy 
5.PIL 
6.Pandas
